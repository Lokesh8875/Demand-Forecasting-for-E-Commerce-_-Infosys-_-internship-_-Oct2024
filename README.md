# Demand-Forecasting-for-E-Commerce-_-Infosys-_-internship-_-Oct2024
This project focuses on demand forecasting for e-commerce, leveraging historical data and machine learning models to predict future demand for products. Accurate demand forecasting is crucial for optimizing inventory, reducing costs, and improving customer satisfaction by ensuring product availability. 
This project is designed to help businesses anticipate customer demand and make data-driven decisions for inventory management, supply chain optimization, and marketing strategies.

Problem Statement:
The e-commerce industry faces fluctuating product demand, influenced by various factors like seasonal trends, marketing campaigns, and consumer behavior. Without accurate forecasting, businesses risk stockouts or overstocking, leading to lost revenue and increased operational costs. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning-based demand forecasting model to predict future demand for products based on historical sales data, web analytics, and external factors like social media influence.

Key Features:
Data Ingestion: Collect and preprocess data from multiple sources, including historical sales records, Google Analytics KPIs, social media engagement (Google clicks, Facebook impressions), and external variables like holidays or events.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand data distributions, relationships, and trends. Analyze key metrics and visualize patterns in sales and demand over time.

Feature Engineering: Create meaningful features from raw data, including:

Temporal features (day of the week, month, seasonality)
Marketing metrics (social media impressions, clicks)
External factors (holidays, special events)
Model Development: Implement various machine learning algorithms for demand forecasting, such as:

Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Gradient Boosting
Time Series models (ARIMA, Prophet)
Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAPE, MAE) and compare models to determine the most accurate forecasting technique.

Visualization and Reporting: Visualize the predicted demand and compare it against actual demand to evaluate forecasting accuracy. Generate business-friendly reports and dashboards to support decision-making.

Tools and Technologies:
Languages: Python (for data manipulation and model development)
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, FBProphet, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Power BI
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Time Series Analysis
Data Handling: SQL, Hadoop, Hive (for large datasets)
Deployment: Flask (for deploying predictive models as web apps)
Data Sources:
Historical Sales Data: Product sales data for previous months/years
Google Analytics: KPIs such as page views, clicks, and bounce rates
Social Media Engagement: Facebook impressions and ad performance
External Factors: Public holidays, special events (e.g., Black Friday)
Goals:
Optimize Inventory Management: Forecast demand to maintain the right level of stock.
Improve Marketing Campaigns: Align marketing strategies with predicted demand trends.
Boost Operational Efficiency: Minimize overstocking and stockouts, reducing operational costs.
How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Install dependencies from the requirements.txt file.
Preprocess the provided data using the data_preprocessing.py script.
Train and evaluate models using the train_model.py script.

Future Work:
Integrating real-time data feeds for continuous demand forecasting.
Expanding the model to forecast demand at a more granular level (e.g., city-level or SKU-level).
Implementing more advanced deep learning techniques like LSTM for better time-series predictions.
